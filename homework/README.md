===

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/softarch-school/ansible-workshop.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/softarch-school/ansible-workshop) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/softarch-school/ansible-workshop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/softarch-school/ansible-workshop)


## 實習重點


### Directory layout

See (again!): Ansible official document - [Best Practices](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout)



## It's your turn...

- Fork.

- Commit & push your changes, and send PR (pull request).

- Check the CI results...


## 想接受挑戰嗎？

- Move the steps for setting `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` to the `nginx` role.

  FYI, see [williamyeh.nginx](https://github.com/William-Yeh/ansible-nginx).


- Try to refactor into more roles, in addition to `nginx`.
