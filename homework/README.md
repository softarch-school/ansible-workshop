## 題目如下

(Continued from Lab #10) Don't reinvent the wheel; use existing roles from Ansible Galaxy:

- Explore and experiment with roles in Ansible Galaxy.

- List your choices in `requirements.yml`.

- Now, your `roles` directory should be empty by default.

- Now, your **main playbook** shouldn't have any `include` statement.

- Make your **main playbook** as small as possible; **ideally less than 5 tasks**.

- If there's no appropriate role in Ansible Galaxy, contribute YOURS to Ansible Galaxy!

- Of course, your results should pass all checks enforced by our CI systems.
