## 實習重點


### Roles repositories

[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/), the official Ansible roles repositories.

See (again!): Ansible official document - [Best Practices](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_best_practices.html#directory-layout)



### 用到的 Ansible Galaxy role(s)

- [`williamyeh.nginx`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/williamyeh/nginx/)


## It's your turn...

- Fork.

- Commit & push your changes, and send PR (pull request).

- Check the CI results...


## 想接受挑戰嗎？

(Continued from Lab #10) Don't reinvent the wheel; use existing roles from Ansible Galaxy:

- Explore and experiment with roles in Ansible Galaxy.

- List your choices in `requirements.yml`.

- Now, your `roles` directory should be empty by default.

- Now, your **main playbook** shouldn't have any `include` statement.

- Make your **main playbook** as small as possible; **ideally less than 5 tasks**.

- If there's no appropriate role in Ansible Galaxy, contribute YOURS to Ansible Galaxy!

- Of course, your results should pass all checks enforced by our CI systems.
