   to go through each lab.


## Note for Windows users

If you're using platforms *without* native support for Ansible (e.g., on Windows), use the following procedure to gain access to the Ansible **control machine**.

First, on the **host machine**, do the following to login to the Ansible control machine:

```
cd control-machine
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Once you login to the **guest machine** (i.e., the Ansible **control machine** within a VM), you'll see the whole project files in the VM's `/vagrant` directory:

```
cd /vagrant
ls -al
```
